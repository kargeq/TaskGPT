# Create To Do Tasks Using ChatGPT
Developer: Kareem Ateeqi


This project allows one to create a list of tasks and then use chatgpt for input on those tasks. 

note that to use this project you must create an env file and create an api token with openai, which the user would need to pay for. 


heres a sample image of how the project looks:<br>

The user has an option to add a filter tasks and remove them  and generate a response which will call the openapi api. Note in the actual project a proxy is being used in lieu of the official api, unfortunately, when testing this out it is likely that you may experience issues without using the official api.
